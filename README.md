# Hello-World
My first repository. Hello, world!
My nickname is Gui. I started coding because one day I want to make a video game a lot of people can enjoy. My goal is to someday join a game company and make wonderful games that are both enjoyable, memorable, and insightful. I love to draw and with my artistic skills, I would like to contribute both of my assets - art and programming - to the world of code. This is just a tidbit about myself.
