# Hello World
My first repository. Hello, world! :tada:

## Introduction
My nickname is Gui my goal as a software developer is to make programs and applications that are useful, efficient, and practical for people. I initially wanted to learn to code so that I could make videogames for people to play, as they were a large part of my life growing up. After taking a couple of Computer Science related courses at my university, I realized there is more to this technology than having fun. It also provides insightful information and data for people wanting to make evolutionary connections or handling raw data in a meaningful way. My goal is to someday join a game company and make amazing games that are both enjoyable, memorable, and insightful. 

My hobbies include:
- Developing & playing videogames :video_game:
- Working on coding projects :computer:
- Learning how game mechanics work :exclamation:
- Gardening :hibiscus:
- Going out for a run :running:

## Repository Goal
While the initial purpose of this repository was to get familiar with creating one, I have decided to reformat it into a collection of all my _Hello World_ programs I have built in different languages.
